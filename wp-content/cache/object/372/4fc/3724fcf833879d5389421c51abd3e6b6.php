<p>As the world is progressing, most organizations and businesses are adopting the latest trends and technologies. One important aspect is the enhanced user experience due to the online availability of services. This project in collaboration with the Supreme Court of Pakistan focuses on the automation of judicial processes. With the social and economic development and the increase in the legal awareness of the public, legal cases are on the rise, which has led to an overload of work for judicial staff. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been used in more fields and disciplines as Artificial Intelligence (AI) has progressed, transforming people's roles and lifestyles. This brings new development possibilities to the judicial field. This collaboration focuses to automate the different processes of the judiciary to help expedite the judicial process.</p>
